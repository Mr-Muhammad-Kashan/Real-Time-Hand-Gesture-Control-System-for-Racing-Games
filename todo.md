# TASK: Real-Time Hand Gesture Control System for Racing Games

## Objective: Create a military-grade, ultra-low latency hand gesture recognition system for racing game control with 3000+ lines of code in a single main.py file

## STEPs:
[ ] STEP 1: Develop comprehensive hand gesture control system with computer vision, AI models, game input simulation, GPU acceleration, and extensive error handling → System STEP
[ ] STEP 2: Create complete documentation and setup instructions for non-technical users → System STEP

## Deliverable: Single main.py file with complete gesture recognition system, requirements.txt, and comprehensive README.md

## Key Requirements:
- Ultra-low latency (<50ms) gesture recognition
- Support for specific racing game gesture mappings
- GPU acceleration with CUDA support
- Military-grade reliability and error handling
- 3000+ lines of comprehensive, well-documented code
- Real-time webcam processing at 30+ FPS
- Seamless integration with racing games (tested with Forza Horizon 5)
